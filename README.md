Getting Started

This app runs on Next.js, built with create-next-app.

Run the dev server

In your project folder, start the dev server with:

    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev

Then head over to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The page will
hot-reload whenever you edit files.

Where to start editing

The main entry point is app/page.tsx. Make a change there and you’ll see
it reflected immediately.

Fonts

We’re using next/font to load Geist, a new font family from Vercel,
automatically optimized for performance.
